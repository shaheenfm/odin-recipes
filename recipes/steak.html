    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) Boneless NYC Strip Steak</li>
            <li>3 cups bourbon whiskey</li>
            <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gently tenderize steaks with a meat mallet. With a sharp knife, lightly score the meat on one side diagonally. 
            Place steaks in a casserole dish, scored side up, and pour bourbon over them. Rub the brown sugar evenly over each steak. 
            Marinate in refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat grill to high heat, and lightly oil grate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the steaks on the hot grill, with the sugar side down. 
            Let cook until sugar has caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes, then flip steaks, and finish cooking to desired doneness.

    </ol>
